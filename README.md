# IoT-Based-Smart-Egg-Hatching-System
In the world of poultry farming, the process of egg incubation is a critical juncture that directly impacts the productivity and sustainability of the industry. Traditional methods often involve manual monitoring, leading to inconsistent results, resource wastage, and inefficiencies. The "IoT Based Smart Egg Hatching System" was conceived to address these challenges by harnessing the power of technology.
